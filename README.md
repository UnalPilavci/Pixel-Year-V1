## 🌟 About the Project

**Pixel Year** is a minimalist personal development assistant that transforms your emotional awareness into a work of art. Bringing the "Year in Pixels" concept to the digital world, the application helps you visualize a broad emotional map of your life by representing each day with a unique color.

> *"Don't just feel your emotions; turn them into a visual story by adding a pixel every day."*

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Mood Grid (Emotional Color Map)
Mark the 365 days of the year with one of 5 different color intensities based on your mood. Over time, this mosaic becomes a long-term reflection of your mental health.

### 💌 Time Capsule (Letter to the Future)
Build a bridge across time. Write down your current thoughts, dreams, or promises to yourself in a letter, set an opening date, and lock it away securely with Firebase.

### 🧘 Gratitude Journal
Finding 3 small things to be grateful for every day programs your brain for positive focus. Pixel Year facilitates this habit with a modern and fluid interface.

### ⚡ Firebase Infrastructure
All your data is synchronized instantly with **Google Firebase**. Thanks to secure login and cloud storage, your pixels and letters are never lost.
